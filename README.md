# React &amp; Webpack 4 From Scratch - No CLI
In this tutorial we will setup React WITHOUT the Create-React-App CLI. 
The CLI is fantastic but many people do not understand how it works behind the scenes. 
In this video we will setup React from scratch with Webpack 4 and Babel.

## Steps to create React Webpack Starter Application
```
npm init
npm i react react-dom
npm i --save-dev webpack webpack-dev-server webpack-cli
npm i --save-dev html-webpack-plugin
// npm i --save-dev babel-core babel-loader babel-preset-env babel-preset-react 
npm i @babel/core babel-loader @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-react --save-dev
```
